# Solidity Developer Roadmap
## Introduction
 Welcome to the Solidity Developer Roadmap! Solidity is a high-level programming language used to write smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. It is a statically  typed, contract-oriented language that is influenced by C++, Python, and JavaScript.

This roadmap is intended to help developers who are new to Solidity to get up to speed with the basics and then dive into more advanced topics. It includes a list of resources and learning materials to help you become a proficient Solidity developer.

## Prerequisites
Before diving into Solidity, it is recommended that you have a basic understanding of programming concepts and at least one programming language. A good understanding of blockchain technology, specifically Ethereum, is also recommended.
